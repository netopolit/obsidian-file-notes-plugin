## About

Obsidian excels at managing markdown files, but working with binary files like videos, PDFs, and images can be limiting—you can't add tags, aliases, or backlinks to them directly.

**File Notes** solves this by creating a companion markdown note for each binary file. For example, a note for `video.mp4` creates `video.md` containing an embedded link:

```markdown
![[video.mp4]]
```

This allows you to:
- Add **tags**, **aliases**, and **frontmatter** to any file type
- Create **backlinks** to binary files
- Write **annotations** and **descriptions** alongside your media
- Keep your file explorer **clean** by optionally hiding source files

## Features

### Basic Operations

| Operation | How to |
|-----------|--------|
| Create file note | Right-click file → **File Notes commands** → **Create file note** |
| Remove file note | Right-click file → **File Notes commands** → **Remove file note** |
| Exclude file | Right-click file → **File Notes commands** → **Exclude from note creation** |
| Exclude folder | Right-click folder → **File Notes commands** → **Exclude folder from note creation** |

### Batch Operations

- **Create notes for all files**: Creates notes for all matching files in your vault

### Auto-Create Notes

Enable automatic note creation in settings. When you add a file with a matching extension, a file note is automatically created.

### Hide Source Files

Keep your file explorer clean by hiding source files that have corresponding notes. Only the markdown notes will be visible, while the original files remain accessible through embedded links.

Toggle this feature via:
- **Settings** → **Hide files with notes**
- Command palette: **Toggle files with notes visibility**

### Customizable Note Template

Configure the content of created notes using a template with the `{{filename}}` placeholder.

**Examples:**
| Template | Result |
|----------|--------|
| `![[{{filename}}]]` | Embeds the file (default) |
| `[[{{filename}}]]` | Links to the file |
| `# {{filename}}` | Heading with file name |

Open command palette with `Ctrl/Cmd + P`:

| Command | Description |

| Create notes for all files | Creates file notes for all matching files in the vault |
| Remove notes from all files | Removes all file notes (with confirmation) |
| Toggle files with notes visibility | Shows/hides source files that have notes |
